#Assumtions

## robots movement:
1) Omnidirectional robot
2) unicycle

## runner movement
1) bouncing robot
2) actively evading the chasers

## Field of vision
1) 360 degrees
2) cone (after having made the motion an unicycle)

## runner probability mapping
1) use gaussian distribution
2) assume mesh (full) communication between the robots

## How robot choose movement
1) cooperative lioyd

## other ideas
1) add fake runners to false positive
2) evaluate different metrics (better more chasers with cheap sensors, or few chasers with good sensors)
